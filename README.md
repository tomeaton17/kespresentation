# kespresentation
Presentation on my internship for previous school.

## Compilation
Must be viewed with pdfpc for video to show. Requires the [metropolis](https://github.com/matze/mtheme) and [pdfpc-commands](https://github.com/pdfpc/pdfpc.github.io/blob/master/demo/pdfpc-video-example/pdfpc-commands.sty) `.sty` files to be in the root directory.
Then run
```bash
latexmk
```
and `main.pdf` will be generated. Can also be seen on [my website](http://tomeaton.uk/kespresentation.pdf)
