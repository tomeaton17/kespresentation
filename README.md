# kespresentation
Presentation on my internship for previous school.

## Compilation
Requires the [metropolis](https://github.com/matze/mtheme), [pdfpc-commands](https://github.com/pdfpc/pdfpc.github.io/blob/master/demo/pdfpc-video-example/pdfpc-commands.sty) and [pdfpc-notes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cebe/pdfpc-latex-notes/master/pdfpcnotes.sty) to be in the root directory.
Then run
```bash
latexmk
```
and `main.pdf` will be generated. Can also be seen on [my website](tomeaton.uk/kespresentation.pdf)
